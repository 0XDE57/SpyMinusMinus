	[x] subclass main windproc and forward messages back to observer

	[x] fix build event dll copy
		[ ] still doesnt copy in case of dll edit only when build will not rebuild dll and run copy event
	[ ] a 32-bit dll must be used for 32-process, and 64 for 64: BadImageFormatException!
		"A 32-bit DLL cannot be injected into a 64-bit process, and a 64-bit DLL cannot be injected into a 32-bit process.
		If an application requires the use of hooks in other processes, it is required that a 32-bit application 
		call SetWindowsHookEx to inject a 32-bit DLL into 32-bit processes, and a 64-bit application call SetWindowsHookEx
		to inject a 64-bit DLL into 64-bit processes. The 32-bit and 64-bit DLLs must have different names."

	[ ] fix bug where closing window freezes process, some cross thread issues with UI
	[x] fix bug when close message window while messages still being recieved = ObjectDisposedException 
	[ ] add hook argugment for attach internal console
	[ ] filter, only show messages x,y,z
	[ ] convert message ID to human-readable name, eg:
		0x0000 WM_NULL
		0x0001 WM_CREATE
		0x0002 WM_DESTROY
		0x0003 WM_MOVE
		0x0200 WM_MOUSEMOVE

	[ ] read message contents eg: 
		0x0200 = WM_MOUSEMOVE
			x,y cords are in lParam: x-coordinate is in the low-order short of the return value; the y-coordinate is in the high-order short
			xPos = GET_X_LPARAM(lParam); 
			yPos = GET_Y_LPARAM(lParam); 
			https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/wm-mousemove
	[ ] documentation on hover over message eg:
		HWND_TOPMOST [-1] = "Places the window above all non-topmost windows. The window maintains its topmost position even when it is deactivated."
		HWND_TOP [0] = "Places the window at the top of the Z order."
		SWP_NOMOVE [0x0002] = "Retains the current position (ignores X and Y parameters)."
	[ ] networked? is this feasable, if so, is there a use case?
